       <div class="grey">
         <h5> We believe that each child is a unique and valuable person created by God for a purpose.  This provides a challenge to present opportunities for each child to develop and grow socially, emotionally, physically, cognitively and spiritually.  Every effort will be made to provide a non-threatening, safe and stimulating environment where each child may investigate, and express his/her ideas while interacting with peers.  We will also strive to develop in each child an awareness of God’s love and care, as well as his/her responsibility to share with and care for others and respect the rights of others.</h5>
         <br>
         <h5>The program’s most important function is to facilitate  play and allow opportunities for exploration using all the senses. The preschool years are a very important time to lay the foundation for concept skills and values that will contribute to each child’s personal growth as a contributing member of our society.</h5><br>
