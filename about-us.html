          Welcome to Discovery Station! This is a unique program that

          programming that is value based from a Biblical perspective.

        <div class="grey">
          <h5 class="subtitle--weight">
            We believe that each child is a unique and valuable person created
            by God for a purpose. This provides a challenge to present
            opportunities for each child to develop and grow socially,
            emotionally, physically, cognitively and spiritually. Every effort
            will be made to provide a non-threatening, safe and stimulating
            environment where each child may investigate, and express his/her
            ideas while interacting with peers. We will also strive to develop
            in each child an awareness of God’s love and care, as well as
            his/her responsibility to share with and care for others and respect
            the rights of others.
          </h5>
          <br />
          <h5>
            The program’s most important function is to facilitate play and
            allow opportunities for exploration using all the senses. The
            preschool years are a very important time to lay the foundation for
            concept skills and values that will contribute to each child’s
            personal growth as a contributing member of our society.

                children be signed into class indicating the name of the person

                arrive no more than 5 minutes prior to class time and to ensure
                pick up is prompt. Your child will look forward to your arrival

                departure the designated pick up person must also sign the child

              </h5>
              <h5>
                As each child arrives for Preschool the teachers will conduct a
                wellness assessment with the parent or caregiver. If the child
                shows symptoms of being ill with the common cold, influenza,
                respiratory disease, COVID 19 – cough, low grade fever, runny
                nose, vomiting - they will be asked to stay at home until the
                symptoms subside. They can be encouraged to call 811 or see a
                doctor if possible. A clearance note from a physician is not
                necessary to return to class.

                Drop off and pick up will be conducted outdoors. There is space
                on the entrance balcony for four adults at one time.
                Parent/caregiver must wait at the bottom of the stairs for the
                space to clear before climbing the stairs. The sign in book will
                be filled out by the teacher as the child arrives or leaves.
                Teachers will assist the children in the classroom to put their
                coats and snack bags away and sanitize their hands. Children
                will read books until teachers are free to begin class. Teachers
                will prepare the children for pick up time and dismiss to
                parents as they wait on the deck or from the playground if they
                are outdoors.

                cough should excuse themselves from teaching the class. Staff
                may return when symptoms subside. No clearance note from a
                physician is required however they should seek medical advice
                should symptoms worsen.

              <h5>
                Should a staff member begin feeling ill during class time, they
                will isolate themselves in the “Story Room” until a substitute

                they may be on the lookout for a new dinosaur in town. Can you
                imagine a dinosaur with many colours, feathers, large feet and a
                long nose. The children can and they are intent on finding him.
