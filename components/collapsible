 <h5>Registration for September is available in November of the previous year on a first come first served basis.</h5><br>

 <h5>All families with children presently enrolled in the program will receive priority registration on a specific day.</h5><br>

<h5> Children should be enrolled for the full ten month program and there is no refund for absences.</h5><br>

<h5> The Preschool follows the Public School Schedule beginning the day after Labour Day and closing for Christmas and Spring Break.  We will be open on public school professional days unless otherwise notified. </h5> <br>

 <h5>Discovery Station will maintain a waiting list for each class of children.  When there are vacancies, new children will be accepted.</h5><br>

 <h5>Children currently enrolled in one group and moving to another group, if space is available and setting is suitable for the child, will receive first priority.</h5><br>

<h5>Families on the wait list will be contacted periodically to ensure that they are still requesting a space.</h5><br>

 <h5>No family will be discriminated against on the basis of race, language, socioeconomic status, gender or sexual orientation.</h5><br>

 <h5>Children who require extra supports are welcome in the program when the centre is able to provide the care that is necessary to promote development.</h5>
