is to facilitate that play and\n            allow opportunities for exploration using all the senses. During the\n            day the child is given the opportunity to experience dramatic play\n            and symbolic play in the housekeeping corner, puppet center, and\n            block/ construction area.\n          </p>\n          <p><br></p>\n\n          <p>\n            Her or his creativity is encouraged through art, play dough and\n            music activities. Fine motor and problem solving skills are\n            encouraged through manipulative toys and art activities. Outdoor\n            play facilitates cooperation and gross motor skills. Group time and\n            story time teaches self-discipline, cooperation and the ability to\n            attend and contribute to a group. It also builds self-esteem.\n          </p>\n          <br>\n\n          <p>\n            The preschool years are a very important time to lay the foundation\n            for concept skills and values that will contribute to each child’s\n            personal growth as a contributing member of our society.\n          </p>\n          <br>\n\n          <p>\n            It is our prayer that each child who participates in The Discovery\n            Station Preschool will graduate into a successful future and that\n            the knowledge and love of God will be an important part of that\n            future.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <hr>\n        <section class=\"grid grid--1x2 grid__card block\">\n          <div class=\"card card--primary\">\n            <header class=\"card__header bg--primary\">\n              <h4>JUNIOR KINDERGARTEN</h4>\n            </header>\n            <div class=\"card__body\">\n              <p>\n                Our diverse, educational thematic preschool curriculum in our\n                Two and Three day program are really a Junior Kindergarten\n                program that dedicates time to lesson extension of activities.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <a href=\"/0b0ab373fbdd9a033cd26bfa5bb4b5bc.html#junior_kindergarten\" class=\"btn btn--light\">LEARN MORE</a>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"card card--secondary\">\n            <header class=\"card__header bg--secondary\">\n              <h4>READY TO READ</h4>\n            </header>\n            <div class=\"card__body\">\n              <p>\n                “A child’s attitude to reading is of such importance that more\n                often than not it determines his/her scholastic fate.

In the summer of 2011, I enrolled my son\n                in your preschool with the knowledge that you were unique. My\n                son was 3 but yet to be potty trained and you accepted him,\n                where many a preschool would not. Based on that fact and\n                additional recommendations, I felt confident in the choice of\n                school we had made. At that time, I surely did not know what a\n                tremendous blessing it would become for my son and my family. My\n                son has blossomed into a wonderful little boy aided in part by\n                the loving but firm and godly guidance of Mrs. Spoor, Mrs. Fun\n                and Mrs. Stephanie. I cannot thank them enough for the patience\n                and kindness shown to not only my children (my daughter started\n                there is past September and is quite the firecracker) but also\n                to myself during some recent difficult times.\n              </p>\n              <br>\n\n              <p>\n                This past summer saw my son being diagnosed with Developmental\n                Coordination Disorder and re-instatement to Langley Supportive\n                Child Development. He had been seen previously by SCD for speech\n                delay but this diagnosis brought a whole team together to help\n                my son reach his potential. Every suggestion for helping my son\n                to succeed has been listened to, implemented and followed\n                through on. Team meetings with his preschool teachers present\n                (not to mention hosting the meeting in their classroom), SCD\n                workers coming into the classroom and endless conversations with\n                me have been met with compassion and attention. Any concerns\n                with either of my children have been presented professionally\n                and with genuine caring for my child's well being.\n              </p>\n              <br>\n\n              <p>\n                I know it was God that brought my family to Discovery Station.\n                It is through Him that all blessings flow and He went above and\n                beyond anything I ever could have imagined preschool could do\n                for either of my children. I wanted to thank you, Mrs. White,\n                for having a heart that led you to hire these amazing women. But\n                also for your curriculum that has my kids knowing the difference\n                between a \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down\" attitude, more about who\n                Jesus is and for providing an environment that has given my\n                children (and myself) new friends.\n              </p>\n              <br>\n\n              <p>\n                Above all this, I want to thank Mrs. Spoor, Mrs. Fun and Mrs.\n                Stephanie for accepting my son for who he is and seeing past the\n                difficulties he presents with. For giving him the opportunity of\n                choice and letting him be himself. You also gave me the clarity\n                and vision to let him be himself and not force him into being my\n                preconceived idea of what a 3 year old \"should\" be. You love\n                him. For all of this and more, I cannot begin to express the\n                depth of my heartfelt gratitude. Thank you for all that you do,\n                are doing and will do for my family and all others blessed to be\n                under your tutelage. My son has truly come out of his shell and\n                is thriving.\n              </p>\n              <br>\n\n              <p>Thank you and Bless you.</p>\n              <br>\n\n              <p>Sincerely,</p>\n              <br>\n            </div>\n            <footer class=\"testmonial--footer\"><p>Lisa Harris</p></footer>\n          </div>\n        </blockquote>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"grid grid--1x2 testimonial-section\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <blockquote class=\"testimonial__quote\">\n          <i class=\"fas fa-quote-left icon icon--testmonial secondary\"></i>\n          <div class=\"testmonial--p\">\n            <p class=\"grey\">\n              Wow!

Since he started Ready to Read, he\n              not only reads new lines every time he comes home, but he reads\n              them clearly. He also understands his reading!
