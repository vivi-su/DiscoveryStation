We will also strive to develop\n            in each child an awareness of God’s love and care, as well as\n            his/her responsibility to share with and care for others and respect\n            the rights of others.\n          </h5>\n          <br>\n          <h5>\n            The program’s most important function is to facilitate play and\n            allow opportunities for exploration using all the senses.
